# CSCI1302_Project1
First Group Project in my CSCI1302 class. Measuring efficiency of sort algorithms.

### Classes and Their Functions
- [x] SortEfficiency (Extends JFrame, contains main())
- [x] SortPanel (Extends JPanel, displays results of algorithm testing)
- [ ] Sort1 (A sort algorithm)
- [ ] Sort2 (A sort algorithm)
- [ ] Sort3 (A sort algorithm)
- [x] StopWatch (Times how long each algorithm takes, imported from /ch14/section_2/, modified)
- [x] ArrayUtil (Generates arrays, imported from /ch14/section_2/, modified)

### Sort Algorithms
  Each of the sort algorithms will depend on their own StopWatch instances.
  Each of the sort algorithms should contain the following methods:
- public SortAlgorithm(int[] array) //initializer. Takes an integer array argument generated by the ArrayUtil in SortPanel. Needs to be initialized with a pre-made array so that every sort algorithm can run the same array.
- public void performSort() //performs the sort algorithm. It should set the sorted values to an array, measure the time it took to perform the sort, and set that time to an int variable.
- public int getTime() //Returns the time it took to perform the sort. Used in SortPanel to display the efficiency of each algorithm.
- public array getSortedArray() //Returns the sorted array. Used in SortPanel to test whether or not every algorithm ends up with the same output. Validates the time.

### Output
  The final product should be a window with a chart. The first 3 columns should each be devoted to the 3 sort algorithms. The fourth column should be either "true" or "false" depending on whether all the search algorithms returned the same sorted array. Each row should contain the time results for each algorithm. For example:

    |----------------------------------------------|
    | Array Size | Sort1 | Sort2 | Sort3 | Correct |
    |----------------------------------------------|
    | 200        | 65ms  | 20ms  | 75ms  | true    |
    | 2000       | 100ms | 300ms | 84ms  | false   |
    | 20000      | 200ms | 300ms | 95ms  | true    |
    |----------------------------------------------|
    |              Button to Run Test              |
    |----------------------------------------------|
